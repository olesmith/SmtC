 In order to improve our approximation of the curve, we include second order derivatives:
 
 \[
  \label{eq:taylor:1}
  \Vector{r}(t)
  \approx
  \Vector{r}(t_0)
  +
  \Vector{r}'(t_0)(t-t_0)
  +
  \frac{1}{2}
  \Vector{r}''(t_0)(t-t_0)^2
\]

The curvature of the curve is the factor $\kappa$, appearing in (\ref{eq:curvature}):

\[
 \frac{d \Vector{t}}{dt}=\kappa \Vector{n},
\]

that is:

\[
 \kappa
 =
 \frac{d \Vector{t}}{dt} \cdot \Vector{n}
\]

Since:

\[
 \Vector{t}
 =
 \frac{ \Vector{r}' }{ |\Vector{r}'| }
\]
