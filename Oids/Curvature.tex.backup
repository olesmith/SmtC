As may found in any textbook on Diferential Geometry, the \emph{Curvature} of a curve, in
a regular point, is the function:

\[
 \kappa=\kappa(t)
 =
 \frac{ \left[ \Vector{r}'(t) \times \Vector{r}''(t)\right] }{ |\Vector{r}'(t)|^3}
 =
 \frac{ x'y''-x''y' }{ |\Vector{r}'(t)|^3}
\]

In the following we denote:

\[
 D(t)=
 x'y''-x''y
 =
 \left[ \Vector{r}'(t) \times \Vector{r}''(t)\right]
 =
 \Vector{ \widehat{r} }'(t) \cdot \Vector{ r}''(t)
\]

Geometrically, the value of $D(t)$ is the (signed) area of the parallellogram
spanned by $\Vector{r}'$ and $\Vector{r}''$.
Moreover, $D(t)=0$, is equivalente to
$\Vector{r}'$ and $\Vector{r}''$ being linearly dependent. In the case of

In points where $\kappa(t) \neq 0$, the curvature ratio is given by: $\rho(t)=\frac{1}{\kappa(t)}$,
and the curvature vector is:


\[
\Vector{\rho}(t)
=
 \rho \Vector{n}
 =
 \frac 
 {
  |\Vector{r}'(t)|^3
  }
  {
    D(t)
  }
  \cdot 
  \frac{ \Vector{\widehat{r}}'(t)  }{ |\Vector{r}'(t)| }
  =
 \frac 
 {
  |\Vector{r}'(t)|^2
  }
  {
    D(t)
  }
  ~
  \Vector{\widehat{r} }'(t)
  =
  \nu(t) \Vector{\widehat{r} }'(t),
\]

where we have introduced the quantity:
\[
 \nu(t)=
 \frac 
 {
  |\Vector{r}'(t)|^2
  }
  {
    D(t)
  }
\]


Finally, the formula for calculating the \emph{Center of Curvature}, is:

\[
 \Vector{c}(t)
 =
 \Vector{r}(t)+\rho \Vector{n}
\]

The curve traced by the centers of curvature, is termed the curve's \emph{Evolute}. In the following,
we will calculate the evolute for some curve families.
